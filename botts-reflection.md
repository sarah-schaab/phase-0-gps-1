* I was struggling with resolving merge conflicts and I wasn't sure when we should be using new branches.

* I am now more comfortable with Git Hub in general. I also got clarification on merge conflicts, using feature branches, and susing git pull to update my local repos.

* I asked the guide if we should do a git pull when starting new challenges (I create a new branch for each challenge).

* I'm not confused by anything specific. The whole concept of using Git and Git Hub is still pretty daunting though.

* I enjoyed the GPS. It was very informative. In the future, I hope I'll be a bit more comfortable in it.
