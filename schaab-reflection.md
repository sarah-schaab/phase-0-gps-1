What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*I was struggling with the concept of pushing and pulling from the git repository because I had not used it during a pairing session previously.*

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
*The concepts we used were git workflow, git commands, git push, git pull, git merge, and pull requests.*

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
*I asked about deleting branches within Github and how it effects the git repository locally.

What still confuses you about Git?
*Most of my questions were answered with the Guide in the GPS. I think that the confusion I still have is from a lack of experience.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
*It was great! It was very helpful and it answered a lot of my questions.
